## Diabetes Diagnosis Prediction System using Logistic Regression and Developement of Smart Website  

The Integration of ML system with a website, aimed at diagnosing a patient to check whether they are affected by diabetes or not.

## About  

Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes is a chronic disease which affects a majority of people globally. Diabetes causes due to Age, lack of exercise, Obesity, bad diet, high blood pressure etc.., According to International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with diabetes across the whole world. Diabetics causes Blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks and Strokes. By 2035, this will be doubled as 592 million patients. Diabetics can only be kept only under control and cannot be cured. Our main goal is to unlock the power of technology to help people finding whether they are being affected by this disease. Diagnosis prediction system for Diabetes are already present in the medical industry. But they failed to diagnose accurately. The Proposed system is based on Logistic Regression, a machine learning model. The Dataset is taken from Kaggle.com website and is originally developed by PIMA which contains 768 data with the following features: Pregnancy, Glucose, BP, Skin-thickness, insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree function, Age. Since we have so many features  to train the system with, it makes the system more reliable and trustable. Exploring important features of diabetes makes it possible for the diagnosis system to accurately predict whether the person is being  affected or not. Experiment results shows that it produces an accuracy of 84.6%.  

## Features

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
                   The First Goal was to find the most significant model suiting the dataset. Factors such as data complexity, the availability of computational resources, size should be considered while choosing the most appropriate model.
                   The ease of use and computational efficiency of the logistic Regression makes the model standout from rest of the Machine Learning Algorithms. It explains why it performs well better than other machine learning algorithms. This is due to its straightforward method for modelling the relationship between the input features and the dependent variable. 
                  Given that the model doesn’t necessarily consume a lot of computational power, logistic regression is best suited for smaller datasets. More Sophisticated algorithms such as SVM, Decision Tree, Neural Networks or Random Forest may perform better than Logistic Regression when dealing with highly nonlinear data.
                 We Created a Logistic Regression model that can precisely predict the outcome given the necessary inputs. Possible Outcomes are Positive and Negative. Positive indicates that diabetes is present. Negative indicates the absence of diabetes.
